There have been so many people who provided support and encouragement to me during this long journey to complete this dissertation. I would like to deeply thank everyone providing me with so much help.

First, I would like to thank my thesis advisor, Nilanga Liyanage, who has been such a terrific mentor and friend during the past years. I would not have reach this point without his help and guidiance. My discussions with him were always enjoyable, not only enhanced my physics insight, but also helped me to become independent and to understand how to become a physicist.

I would like to thank my Jefferson Lab supervisor, Jian-ping Chen, who quickly brought me involved in the collabration and enthusiastically answered my questions and help me to better understand the physics behind the experiment. I spent most of my graduate time at Jefferson Lab and I learned a lot from his advices and help, both in research and in everyday life. It was my great privilege to get this chance to work with him.

I would like to thank my thesis committee members: Edward Murphy, Kent Paschke and Xiaochao Zheng for their time in carefully going through this document and providing valuable comments.

I would like to thank Alexandre Camsonne, Jian-Ping Chen, Don Crabb and Karl Slifer for their role as the spokepersons in this experiment. Our experiment experienced many problems. Their delibrate plan guaranteed a promising experiment. I would also like to thank the Hall A collaboration and the JLab target group. Without their efforts, the experiment would not have been a success.

I would like to thank my colleagues, either graduate students or post-docs, for their hard work to ensure the experiment was a success: Toby Badman, Melissa Cummings, Min Huang, Jie Liu, Pengjia Zhu, Ryan Zielinski, Kalyan Allada, Ellie Long, James Maxwell, Vince Sulkosky and Jixie Zhang. Thanks to Jixie for teaching me to build a simulation package and for many valuable discussions on the spectrometer optics study. I would also like to thank Kalyan for teaching me the detector and DAQ setup.

I would like to thank all my friends at University of Virginia and Jefferson Lab. Their friendship made my graduate study an enjoyable experience. They are: Xiaping Tang, Zukai Wang, Yuxiang Zhao, Li Ye, Xiuchang Yang, Yi Qiang, Chaolun Wu, Chunhua Chen, Yuncheng Han, Zhihong Ye, Zongwen Yang, Longwu Ou, Yang Wang, Zhiwen Zhao, He Zhang, He Huang, Kai Jin, Peng Peng, Wei Liu, Jin Huang, Chao Peng, Yawei Zhang, Wei Tang, Siyu Jian, Danning Di, Kondo Gnanvo, Aiwu Zhang, Mei Zhang, Yifei Shi, Luna Yang, Moran Chen, Ryan Duve.

I would like to thank my parents for their persistent support and endless encouragements. It was not easy for them to push me so far away to pursue my dream, but they were always understanding of my decision.

Finally, thanks to my wife Deli Zhu for all her love and support which made all of this possible.
